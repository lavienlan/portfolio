				<p> My name is Rachel Jing and I am currently a grade 10 student attending William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Canada.
				As a person, I am a curious individual who thrives on change and spontaneity. Listening to other people talk about their passions and indulging in 
				seemingly nonsensical but, on the contrary, I believe to be rather intellectual conversations are frequent pastimes of mine. I am dedicated to 
				achieving academic excellence, but more importantly, making the most out of my educational experience and enjoying the process of both learning 
				and experimenting; discovering more and more about myself as I go. I very recently picked up the electric guitar and also dancing, but only about 11 
				years ago. I am currently looking for more opportunities outside of school to explore and delve deeper into subjects I enjoy.

			<h2>Extra Learning</h2>
			<p>Learning HTML and CSS to create my portfolio was an invaluable experience for me this semester, as it was a chance to challenge myself 
				and create something from scratch with no prior knowledge. Despite only having dabbled in HTML in sixth grade and having some experience 
				in digital design, I dove in headfirst and taught myself the ropes. It was a fun, yet difficult journey, but with the help of online 
				tutorials and YouTube videos, I was able to create a portfolio that I'm proud of, all within a limited timeframe.

				As the website grew more complex, I found myself getting lost in my own code, struggling to keep track of where certain elements were 
				located. However, despite these challenges, I enjoyed the process of designing a website, even though it was more tedious compared to 
				using pre-made templates or website builders. Overall, I believe this experience gave me a great hard skill that I can use when applying 
				for future jobs, something I plan to do this upcoming summer, and also allowed me to discover something new that I enjoy doing.

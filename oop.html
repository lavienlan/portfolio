				<p> 
					OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming 
					computer programming model that is based on the concept of objects. 
					Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it
					is designed to support the creation and manipulation of objects. In 
					Java, you can create classes that define the attributes and behaviors
					of objects, and then create instances of those classes to represent 
					specific objects.

				<p>
					To put it more simply, it is a way of writing computer programs that 
					focuses on the concept of "objects". Much like a tangible, real-life object, 
					an object is a thing that has certain characteristics (also called 
					"attributes" or "properties") that can do certain things (also called "methods"
					 or "behaviors"). For example, you could think of a car as an object. It has 
					 attributes like color and model, and it can do things like accelerate, brake, 
					 and turn. When you write a program using OOP in Java, you define classes that 
					 describe the objects in your program. A class is like a blueprint or a recipe 
					 for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that all objects 
					 of that class will have. For example, you could define a class called "Car" 
					 that has attributes like "color" and "model", and behaviors like "accelerate", 
					 "brake", and "turn". Then, you could create individual objects of that class 
					 that represent specific cars, each with their own values for the attributes.
				</p>

				<h2 class = "subtitle"> Other Terms</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Encapsulation:</strong> hide the inner workings of an object from the outside world, and 
					only expose a public interface that can be used to interact with the object. 
					This helps to ensure that the object's state remains consistent and that it 
					can't be accessed or modified in unexpected ways. Access modifiers, namely 
					private and public.
					<br><br>
					<strong>Inheritance:</strong> ability to create new classes that are based on existing classes, and 
					inherit their attributes and behaviors. This allows you to create more specific 
					classes that share common attributes and behaviors with their parent classes.
